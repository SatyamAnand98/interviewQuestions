'''
Design a Family Tree of parents and children (one child can have many parents and vice versa) and write two functions :-
a.) tillNode() :- prints all the ancestors (parents, grandparents and above) of a particular node.
b.) fromNode() :- prints all the children (children, grandchildren and below) of a particular node.
You can use any data structure of your choice to implement above. Input will be the number of relations in the tree between different nodes (PARENT<space>CHILD).
